Create 4 regions for 4 approaches
Input the direction of flow for each region
Input the virtual stop lines for each zone  ----------- to be done!!!!!!!!
If the corner points move in the flow direction, detect them. The rest are as good as stationary.
Stationary points/Total no.of points >= .85 ==> It's a red
Detected moving points/Total no.of points >= .85 ==> It's a green
We have red region and green regions

Have to detect rlrs:
1. Track corner points moving in the flow direction during red
2. Create regions just outside the stop line and detect movement in the direction of flow for that region.
